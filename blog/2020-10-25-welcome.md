Welcome, Here we are trying to go for a data driven comprehensive analysis regarding the agri supply chain of Sri Lanka. According to the government official reports, over 7% of contribution to GDP (Gross Domestic Product) have been covered from the agriculture sector. On the other hand, when we consider the number of employment generated by this sector is quite significant. In a sense of that, data driven analysis in the local agriculture supply chain becomes much more important with the factors, problems and difficulties that we are facing at the movement.
